## Michael Villarreal

Hello! My name is Michael Villarreal, and I am Computer Science PhD student at the University of Memphis. While I do have a variety of different interests, I focus mainly on machine learning and AI. My area of research right now is within the computer vision realm of machine learning as it relates to denoising autoencoders and creating robust models.


## Android Applications

During the pandemic, I decided to pick up a new skill in order to improve my software development ability! Some of the projects listed below are the culmination of that.

### Sable's Diary

This one was both fun to make and provides great utility for me, and it involves one of my favorite things: my hedgehog Sable! (Yes, she was named after the Animal Crossing character).
