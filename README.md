## Michael Villarreal

Hello! My name is Michael Villarreal, and I am Computer Science PhD student at the University of Memphis. While I do have a variety of different interests, I focus mainly on machine learning and AI. My area of research right now is within the computer vision realm of machine learning as it relates to denoising autoencoders and creating robust models.


## Android Applications

During the pandemic, I decided to pick up a new skill in order to improve my software development ability! Some of the projects listed below are the culmination of that.

### Sable's Diary

This one was both fun to make and provides a great utility for me, and it involves one of my favorite things: my hedgehog Sable! (Yes, she was named after the Animal Crossing character).

This Android app allows me to keep track of what my hedgehog eats and drinks on a daily basis. It allows me to put in the date on which the measurements were taken and allows me to put how much she weighs as well. Keeping track of this information is especially useful as hedgehogs can hide illnesses well and keeping track of this information can allow me to catch if any problems arise.

### Chord System

This app was a quick one that I did for a homework assignment in my distributed systems class. The goal of the homework was to code and demonstrate the chord system.

Here is a link to the video I submitted to the professor explaining the app: https://youtu.be/XXWSQPFRaxk
